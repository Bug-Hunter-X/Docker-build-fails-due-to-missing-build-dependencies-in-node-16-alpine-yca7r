# Docker Build Failure: Missing Dependencies in node:16-alpine

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Node.js applications in Docker using slim images like `node:16-alpine`. The issue is that these images often lack essential build-time dependencies, causing `npm install` to fail.

## Problem

The provided `Dockerfile` attempts to build a Node.js application using `node:16-alpine`. This image is intentionally small, but it omits many common build tools. As a result, the `RUN npm install` command fails because necessary libraries for compiling native modules are not present.

## Solution

The `Dockerfile.fixed` file corrects this by adding a `RUN apk add --no-cache ...` instruction to install the necessary build-essential dependencies before running `npm install`.  This ensures all required packages are available to successfully compile any native dependencies used by your application.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to build the original `Dockerfile` using `docker build -t my-app .`.
3. Observe the build failure.
4. Build the corrected `Dockerfile.fixed` using `docker build -t my-app-fixed .`.
5. Notice the successful build.
